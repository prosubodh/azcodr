# AGENTS.md

> **Operating Framework & Agent Directives**  
> **Rule Zero:** Assume nothing. Every action must be grounded in verified evidence from this workspace or direct instructions from the user.  
> **Open-Source Mandate:** Always utilize 100% open-source tools, frameworks, libraries, and packages across all architectural domains.  
> **Atomicity Mandate:** All rules, skills, code units, migrations, and transactions must be strictly atomic (indivisible, self-contained, and composable with full ACID safety).  
> **Architecture Mandate:** Architecture emerges strictly from problem constraints and execution targets (Problem-First; zero tool/platform bias). Match architectural style to problem topology (Hexagonal for enterprise backends, Platform Scripting for extensions, Data-Oriented Design for game engines, Command Pipeline for CLIs, Game Loop for canvas games). Never force premature abstractions or universal templates.

## 1. Zero-Assumption Operating Framework
### Core Principles
1. **No External Assumptions:** You have no prior knowledge of external setups, hidden tools, libraries, or unverified conventions outside this workspace.
2. **Ground Truth Only:** A statement is only true if proven by a workspace file, verified command output, or direct user instruction.
3. **Unknown Until Verified:** If something is not explicitly written in the workspace or stated by the user, treat it as unknown.
4. **Strict Open Standards:** Standardize on open-source solutions and open specs (Semgrep, Trivy, Gitleaks, OpenTelemetry, OPA, OCI, Wasm, CloudEvents).
5. **Problem-First & Topology Alignment:** Problem domain and operational constraints (latency budget, GC tolerance, memory, execution environment) strictly dictate the architectural style and toolchain. Never select tools before defining the problem space.
6. **Evolutionary Architecture & Refactor-Before-Add:** As complexity grows, code must graduate across explicit architectural tipping points. Refactor structure first under existing green tests before implementing new features. Never append code into rotting files.
7. **True Incremental TDD & Nano-Cycles:** Never dump test suites in batches ("Test-First Waterfall"). Follow Uncle Bob's Three Laws: write one micro-assertion at a time, verify RED failure output, write minimal code to turn GREEN, and refactor under green.
8. **Systemic Atomicity:** Every skill, rule, database transaction, and refactoring step must be atomic (Single Responsibility, zero side-effects, full rollback).
9. **Workspace Sovereignty:** Total containment within the local workspace root (`./`). Zero interference from global configs, tools, or sibling projects.
10. **Continuous Learning:** Ingest all verified defects, lessons, and architectural invariants directly into domain rules and `memory.md`.

### The 5 Core Branch Questions
Before acting on any decision branch, answer:
1. **Current State:** What do workspace files currently show? (Inspect before assuming).
2. **Target Goal:** Is the goal clear, bounded, and explicit? (Stop & ask if ambiguous).
3. **Tools & Setup:** Are tools defined in workspace configs? (Never assume commands exist).
4. **Impact & Risk:** Have all references, callers, and side effects been traced?
5. **Verification:** How will we prove it works with tests or build commands?

### Conflict Resolution & Order of Authority
1. **User Request (Current Session)** ➔ 2. **Workspace Configurations** (lockfiles, linters, scripts) ➔ 3. **Existing Code Patterns** ➔ 4. **Direct Confirmation (Stop & Ask)**.

### Action Boundaries
- **ALWAYS:** Read files before editing; verify commands before running; verify results with evidence.
- **ASK FIRST:** Adding/removing external dependencies; deleting/renaming files; changing DB schemas or build scripts; modifying existing tests.
- **NEVER:** Guess paths, flags, or signatures; silently ignore errors; bypass unresolved questions.

## 2. Execution Lifecycle

Progress all tasks systematically through the unified **Agent Cognitive & Agile Domain Lifecycle**, seamlessly interlocking the 5 agent operational disciplines with the 5-phase domain engineering pipeline:
```
1. DISCOVER / REQUIREMENTS   ──► Read-only inspection; Problem Space & operational constraints; INVEST stories & Gherkin.
2. INTERROGATE / DOMAIN     ──► Relentless questioning; Ubiquitous Language, Aggregate invariants & state machines.
3. PLAN / OUTER TDD         ──► Minimal blast radius; failing Outer Acceptance Test (UI/API RED).
4. EXECUTE / INNER TDD      ──► Incremental nano-cycles (Uncle Bob's 3 Laws: 1 micro-assertion RED ➔ MINIMAL pass GREEN ➔ REFACTOR).
5. VERIFY / DoD & PROOF     ──► Outer test turns GREEN; boundary smoke tests & 100.00% test coverage.
```

## 3. Progressive Disclosure: Specialized Domain Rules

## 4. Agent Configuration & Workspace Architecture
- **Progressive Disclosure Principle:** Never load all documentation upfront. Rely on the table above to pull specialized instructions only when performing relevant tasks.
- **Nested AGENTS.md for Monorepos:** In multi-package workspaces (e.g. `apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`), place package-specific conventions in nested `AGENTS.md` files scoped strictly to those subtrees.
- **Specialized Skills Catalog:** On-demand multi-step workflows are encapsulated under `.agents/skills/`:
  - [`agentic-architect`](.agents/skills/agentic-architect/SKILL.md): Authoring, auditing, and modularizing agent configurations and skills.
  - [`product-analyst`](.agents/skills/product-analyst/SKILL.md): Aligning OKRs, backlog ordering (Kano/MoSCoW/RICE), INVEST stories, and Gherkin criteria.
  - [`compliance-audit`](.agents/skills/compliance-audit/SKILL.md): Conducting SOC 2, ISO 27001, and OWASP audits using open-source scanners.
  - [`clean-code-refactor`](.agents/skills/clean-code-refactor/SKILL.md): Refactoring code smells with Clean Code, SOLID, and design patterns.
  - [`lets-build`](.agents/skills/lets-build/SKILL.md): Conducting architecture interviews to finalize stack, frameworks, package managers, and bootstrapping projects.
  - [`relentless-questioner`](.agents/skills/relentless-questioner/SKILL.md): Dynamic context-aware interrogation loops before planning and coding.
- **Relentless Skill Architecture Inquiry:** Never author or update skills on assumptions. Interrogate all 7 inquiry branches (placement, trigger intent, domain truth, gotchas/anti-patterns, determinism, progressive bloat, verification loop) defined in [docs/rules/agentic_configuration.md](./docs/rules/agentic_configuration.md) before writing `SKILL.md`.
- **Workspace Memory & Knowledge Hub:** Consult [`memory.md`](./memory.md) for ADRs, and [`docs/knowledge/ubiquitous_language.md`](./docs/knowledge/ubiquitous_language.md) for domain glossaries.
- **Harness Parity & Symlinks:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `agents.md` must remain identical via filesystem symbolic links to eliminate configuration divergence across different agent harnesses.
